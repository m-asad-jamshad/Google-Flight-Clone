# Google Flight Clone

## ‚ö†Ô∏è API Status Notice

This project uses **RapidAPI** for flight data. Currently experiencing API limitations:

- **API Provider**: RapidAPI (Free Tier)
- **Current Status**: Free quota exhausted
- **Error Code**: 429 (Too Many Requests)
- **Impact**: Live flight data is temporarily unavailable

### What this means:

- The application interface works perfectly
- Flight search functionality is temporarily limited
- APIs will return 429 errors until quota resets or upgraded plan

### To fix this:

1. **Upgrade RapidAPI Plan**: Purchase a paid plan for higher quota limits
2. **Wait for Reset**: Free tier quotas typically reset monthly
3. **Alternative APIs**: Consider switching to other flight data providers
